# Bike Sales Analysis

 Introduction
 
In this project, I developed an Excel dashboard to analyze the factors influencing bike purchases. The primary objective was to understand the demographic and socio-economic variables driving bike sales. I explored various dimensions, such as income, gender, commuter distance, number of children, vehicles owned, age, and occupation. The dashboard provided insights filtered by region (Europe, North America, Pacific), marital status (Married, Single), and education level (Bachelor’s, Graduate, High School, Partial College, Partial High School). The data underwent a thorough cleaning process before analysis, including removing duplicates, creating age brackets, and addressing missing data and errors. I also used pivot tables to analyze various attributes.

 Key Findings

1. Income and Gender Impact on Bike Sales
   
 Overall: Men, on average, earn higher incomes ($60,124) than women ($55,774), and this pattern is observed across all regions. Europe had the largest gap, where males earned 18% more than females.

 ![Income and Gender](https://github.com/JoanneGuandaru/Bike-Sales-Analysis/blob/main/Income%20&%20Gender.PNG?raw=true)
 
 By Region:
North America has the highest average income for both men and women, with men earning $65,455 and women $64,909; making the region the most lucrative for bike sales.

 Europe has the lowest income levels for bike buyers, with women earning $39,136 and men $46,269.
 
 Pacific shows both genders having closer income levels, with women earning $62,917 and men $65,385.
 
 By Education:
 
 Graduate Degree holders have the highest average income ($68,049 for men, $61,698 for women), while Partial High School education shows the largest income disparity with men earning $58,000 and women $32,000.
 
By Marital Status

Among married individuals, males had a slight income advantage, but overall, both genders in this group earned more than the average across regions.

Insight: Higher income is positively correlated with bike sales, especially for men. Income disparities are most pronounced in Europe and for those with lower education levels.

Recommendation: Target high income earners with premium bike models, especially in North America and for Graduate Degree holders. In Europe, consider more affordable options or targeted promotions for women.


2. Commuter Distance
   
Overall: Buyers who commute 0-1 miles purchase the most bikes (200 bikes); making this group the key target for sales. Those commuting more than 10 miles buy the fewest (46 bikes).

![Commuter Distance](https://github.com/JoanneGuandaru/Bike-Sales-Analysis/blob/main/Commuter%20distance.PNG?raw=true)

 By Region:
 
 In Europe, short commutes (0-1 miles) dominate bike sales (102 bikes), while distances over 10 miles see the least sales (3 bikes).
 
 North America shows a preference for medium commutes (2-5 miles, 70 bikes), followed by longer distances (5-10 miles).
 
 Pacific buyers showed a similar trend to Europe, prefering short commutes, with 0-1 miles accounting for 38 bikes.

Insight: Short commuter distances (01 miles) are the most common among bike buyers, particularly in Europe and Pacific regions.

Recommendation: Offer marketing campaigns that highlight bikes as an ideal choice for short-distance commutes. In North America, emphasize medium distance commuting options.


3. Age Impact on Bike Sales
   
 Overall: The Middle aged group (31-49 years) dominates bike purchases, accounting for 336 bikes; making up 68% of bike purchases. The younger (under 30) and older groups (over 50) lag far behind.

![Age](https://github.com/JoanneGuandaru/Bike-Sales-Analysis/blob/main/Age.PNG?raw=true)
 
 By Region:
 
 North America has the largest number of middle aged bike buyers (155 bikes).
 
 Pacific and Europe also show higher middle-aged purchases, but older and younger groups have lower engagement.

Insight: Middle-aged buyers (31-49) are the most likely to purchase bikes across all regions.

Recommendation: Focus on marketing towards the middle-aged demographic, offering features that appeal to health-conscious or active individuals in this age group.



4. Number of Children
   
 Overall: Buyers with no children purchased the most bikes (142), while those with 5 children bought the fewest (18).

![Children](https://github.com/JoanneGuandaru/Bike-Sales-Analysis/blob/main/No%20of%20children.PNG?raw=true)
 
 By Region:
 
 Europe follows the overall trend, with childless buyers accounting for 57 bikes.
 
 North America has a more even distribution, with childless buyers (42 bikes) and those with one child (48 bikes) being top purchasers.
 
 Married buyers: Those with no children and 1 child dominate bike purchases.

Insight: Households without children are more likely to buy bikes, while families with many children purchase fewer.

Recommendation: Tailor product offerings for single buyers or small families, focusing on convenience and cost effectiveness. Consider family-focused marketing for those with one or two children. Married individuals with one child were the most likely to purchase bikes (69 sales), making them an important target for marketing.



5. Number of Cars
   
 Overall: Households with one car made up the largest segment of buyers (152 bikes sold), followed closely by households with no cars (151 bikes sold), highlighting the demand for alternative transportation among this group.
 
 By Region:
 
Europe had a significant number of buyers with no cars (76 sales), showing the highest interest in bikes as a primary mode of transport.

North America and Pacific show strong bike purchases among those with 1 or 2 cars.

Insight: People without cars or with a single car are the most likely to buy bikes, particularly in Europe.

Recommendation: Focus on marketing bikes as alternative transport solutions for carless households or single car families, particularly in Europe.


6. Occupation
   
Overall: Professionals dominate bike purchases (150 bikes), followed by Skilled Manual workers (115 bikes). Management and Manual workers are the smallest groups.

 By Region:
 
 North America has the largest number of Professionals purchasing bikes (94), while Europe has more Clerical workers purchasing bikes (64).
 
The Pacific region also had strong sales among professionals (36 sales), while manual laborers had a smaller share (11 sales).

In Europe, the clerical workforce (64 sales) dominated the bike purchasing demographic, suggesting a distinct occupational trend in that region.

Insight: Bike purchases are most common among Professionals, particularly in North America.

Recommendation: Focus on targeting professionals and skilled workers, offering models that appeal to their lifestyle and commuting needs.

 Recommendations
 
1. Target Middle-Aged Buyers:

Marketing strategies should focus on middle-aged buyers (31-49 years), as they represent the majority of bike sales across all regions.

Tailored campaigns that appeal to this demographic’s lifestyle and commuting habits could boost sales further.

2. Expand in North America:

North America has the highest earning buyers and the strongest bike sales among longer commuters (2-5 miles). Expanding bike models suited for longer commutes could capitalize on this trend.

Offering financing options or discounts for families with multiple children may attract more buyers in this region.

3. Leverage Environmental and Car-Free Living Campaigns:

Europe has a large number of car-free households buying bikes. Highlighting the environmental benefits and cost savings of bike commuting could further strengthen this trend.

Campaigns in the Pacific should continue focusing on alternative transport for car-free or one-car households.

4. Occupational-Focused Advertising:

Since professionals are the largest buyer group, targeting this demographic with premium bike models or accessories for commuting could increase sales.

For regions like Europe, where clerical workers are prominent, offering budget-friendly or ergonomic commuting solutions could capture additional market share.
